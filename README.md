Repository
==========
This is a repository where I just store code which does not fit anywhere else


This Repository contains two projects

Probability:

Monte Carlo simulations of Roulette and Poker
Developed using Java for a data management course.

Tile-Adventure:

An adventure game featuring a GUI.
Developed using Java


This also contains some code from assignments. It is only really here so I don't lose it.
